# About the Makaton Gesture Recognition Tool

The **Makaton Gesture Recognition Tool** is an assistive AI system that uses **computer vision** and **gesture recognition** to translate Makaton gestures into English text in real time.

It is part of my (Omotayo Omoyemi’s) ongoing research in **AI and Education**, exploring inclusive learning through technology for individuals with communication difficulties.

### Key Features
- Real-time gesture-to-text recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV
- Tested with students at Derby Cathedral School, UK
- Designed for inclusive education and accessibility research
