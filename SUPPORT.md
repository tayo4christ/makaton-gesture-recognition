## Using This Tool vs. Learning Makaton

This project helps recognise a small set of Makaton-style gestures for research and prototyping.
It does **not** replace:

- Official Makaton training
- Speech and language therapy
- Professional communication support

If you, a learner, or a family member needs support with Makaton itself, please seek:

- Official Makaton training providers
- Speech and language professionals
- Local schools and support centres experienced with Makaton or similar communication systems
